# IziTravel v8.0.1 (alpha)
![](Images/logo.png)

My attempt to "recover" (pseudo-upgrade via quick/fast "PWA" dev) discontinued Izi.Travel for WindowsMobile 8. My mini-goal is only PWA-like simplest "UWP"... no less, no more :) However, full R.E./RnD is also good idea!

## About
I noticed that IziTravel "deal makers" decided to erase/delete IziTravel project from Microsoft Store. Also, I explored xap package file and notices: the code is not UWP-compatible, it's obsolete WM8 code.
So, I created the simplest "pseudo-PWA" app to display IziTravel web site on "winphone" with Windows 10 Mobile.
